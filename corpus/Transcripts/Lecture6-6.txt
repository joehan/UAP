ERIC S. LANDER: Now, what happens to Mendel? Mendel makes this amazing discovery. He produces this great paper. Mendel never writes an amazing paper again. 

His entire scientific reputation hangs on this 1865 paper. He ends up working on another plant, a hawkweed that turns out to be a very unfortunate experimental choice. It has a lot of weird properties. And he can't ever make sense of it. 

And what Mendel does, because he's so successful, is Mendel gets promoted to be the abbot of the monastery, becomes consumed with administration and never really writes another great scientific paper, although he studies meteorology and other things like that. But that's pretty much it for Mendel's career. Mendel passes away. 

And this Mendel stuff is kind of largely forgotten. And the 1800s roll along. And an entirely different line of work appears. The entirely different line of work-- section five now-- cytology, cells in microscopes, people studying cells in microscopes. 

Well, microscopes had been invented long before. But when you looked under a microscope at cells, you could see all sorts of interesting structures, all sorts of interesting shapes and things like that. But what really began to make cytology interesting was the German chemical industry. 

The German chemical industry began inventing dyes, dyes you could stain things. And somebody thought to put dyes on cells. And they put dyes on cells. And what they found was that in the nucleus of a cell at certain times, dyes would stick to certain structures that look like these things, these some kind of bodies there. 

And these colored things were really interesting. And they had no idea what they were. And what do you do in science when you have no idea what something is? 

STUDENT: Poke at it. 

ERIC S. LANDER: You poke at it. But the problem is, you're going to poke in the microscope there and mess it up. Now, in order to make yourself feel better, you give it a name, because if you give a name, you're in control over it. The only thing they knew about these colored bodies were that they were colored bodies. And so they called them chromosomes, meaning colored things. 

That's what it means. Chromosome means colored thing. So they found these chromosomes. And they didn't know what these chromosomes were doing. But they made observations of cells at many points of their cell division. 

It turns out, in the 1800s, could not take movies. But they inferred by looking at cells at many times that these chromosomes underwent a remarkable choreography. They did a dance during cell division. And for you, let's show a movie of what that looks like. 

Let's get a black and white movie of a plant cell here-- fire away. These are these colored things. We don't have it in color. It's a black and white picture. 

Just look what they're doing as the cell is under-- this is a lily of some sort, I think. And it's undergoing division, this cell. And look at this, they're moving around. They're moving around. They're arranging themselves. 

They're getting organized in some way. There we go. They're getting organized. Whoa. Check that out. 

Every one of them split, goes apart, and there you go. How interesting. Let's pull up another quick movie. Let's pull up a movie of a sea urchin. Check out this sea urchin here. 

Here we go. It'll go really quickly. Whoop-- chromosomes going away. Let's pull up a frog embryo. Check out the frog embryo here. 

Check out those chromosomes. Tell me what you see here. And they're coming together. They're coming together. They're getting them all organized. Look at that. 

Oh, but there's a straggler. There's the straggler here. We're going to wait for the straggler. I'm waiting for the straggler. 

There we go. The straggler gets in there, and now it's ready to go. There we go, pulls back, divides, two cells. Not only do they organize themselves beautifully, but they even had the good courtesy to wait for the last chromosome to join. It is incredibly polite choreography. 

This was cell division, typical cell division called mitosis. What's going on here in mitosis? So in mitosis-- now, from those gorgeous pictures, it's not so obvious how to follow everything. It took people a long time to figure out what was going on. 

And what the picture ends up looking like is something like this. That chromosomes, which we saw were going to split apart, really have two copies of something. And they're lining up along the middle of the cell. Take some interpretation to say this here. 

But it looks like they're lining up across the middle of the cell. When they've got themselves all perfectly lined up like that, they pull back and split apart. That's it. Yes? 

STUDENT: How accelerated was the video we were watching, or slowed down? 

ERIC S. LANDER: A fair amount accelerated. A fair amount accelerated, because we have a limited time in the class. So it's time lapse photography. That's right. So pretty easy. 

These things, somehow there were two of them. You saw how they split apart, right? When they split apart, there's singletons, but they must, at the time they appeared there look like a little x held together in the middle, because there were two copies of this thing. And by the way, after this movie, the chromosomes seem to disappear. 

And then they come back and re-condense, reappear. So they condense nicely into these shapes but then seem to go away. They're still there, but you don't see them. And they come back and they condense. And when they condense, the next time they'll have these two copies again. 

So somehow they've been duplicated while you're not watching. That was mitosis. But there was something else kind of interesting, which was when cells didn't just divide in their normal way, but cells divided to make gametes, say, like sperm or eggs, the cells that undergo fertilization. To make gametes, a very different picture emerged. 

The very different picture was that in meiosis, meiosis here, the chromosomes line up differently. Instead of the Xs, two copies of the same chromosome lining up like that all down the middle, it'll line up like this. I'll make a little chromosome here. 

And its little partner is over here. And the first meiotic division, meiosis number one, did not split apart the Xs. What it does is, it gives rise to two cells, each of which gets one copy of each pair. Then, in meiosis two-- here's my little chromosome and my big chromosome. 

Just for the sake of argument, I'll call that one chromosome one and chromosome two. We've got chromosome one here, chromosome two. So we've got this. 

In the second meiotic division, meiosis two, now it undergoes a division that looks for all the world just like mitosis. And it gives rise now to that. That's it. So there's a big difference. 

What's the big difference here? Up there, there were four chromosomes or two pairs of chromosomes. They split. And you still have those four chromosomes. 

Here, I've only got two. They came in pairs and each offspring cell at the end of this process gets one of the two. Let's look over here. Mitosis-- bring up my mitosis a second if you would. 

In mitosis, we have our homologs, meaning the two copies of a given chromosome. Each chromosome, they come in pairs here. They each split. Now, this picture here doesn't have them lined up nicely over each other like I did. But this is one chromosome, the other chromosome, and here are the Xs. 

I drew them lined up over on top of each other. But you can draw them any way you want to. And they get tugged. One of the two pieces gets tugged here. And the other piece gets tugged here. 

And you end up here with, the original chromosomes were duplicated, were separated. And it gets back to its initial state. That's mitosis. But in meiosis, we have an extra step. 

Chromosomes here-- here, we're now just showing this pair. They get pulled over. And then secondarily, they undergo this separate division. So now, what does that tell us? Chromosomes come in pairs. 

This chromosome thing was found in 1889, 1890, actually, just about the time Buchner is working in his lab. Same time people are discovering chromosomes, and they're working out this choreography that says, when gametes are made, when you make sperm or eggs, something occurs in pairs. And one copy of each pair randomly goes to the daughter cell. 

And just about that time-- 1900 actually, January of 1900-- people begin to redo the heredity experiments and rediscover and re-appreciate Mendel. Mendel is getting rediscovered. And the chromosome choreography is being worked out. 

And by 1902, someone says, wait a second, this idea that Mendel had of discrete particles of inheritance coming in pairs and going randomly, and these chromosomes coming in pairs and distributing randomly. Oh, we don't have to think abstractly anymore. That was a problem with Mendel. It was all so abstract. We didn't know what a gene was. 

It must be that these chromosomes are genes or carry genes or have something to do with genes because they have the same choreography. And so the idea starts floating around in 1902 that chromosomes must be the basis of heredity. It's controversial, but it's beginning to catch on. 

What a beautiful, beautiful idea-- the Chromosome Theory of Inheritance. That here is the physical manifestation of Mendel's abstract genes, that when chromosomes line up, maybe this chromosome has the roundness gene. And let's see, this copy of the chromosome has been duplicated, but it's got the big Rs. 

And that guy there has got the little rs. And this chromosome over here, it's got the big G on it. That's the big G carrying chromosome. And over here, this chromosome, it's got the little g. 

And not only do the big Rs and little rs go randomly, one to each daughter cell, and the big Gs and little gs go randomly, one to each daughter cell, but there's no correlation between the big Rs and the big Gs, because they're on different chromosomes. So that explains Mendel's second law. Mendel's second law is perfectly explained by the chromosome theory, because if the genes are on different chromosomes, they're getting assorted independently. It's beautiful. 

But there's a problem. How many traits did Mendel study? 

STUDENT: Seven. 

ERIC S. LANDER: Seven. How many pairs of chromosomes do peas have? No reason you should know, but the answer is seven. What if Mendel had studied an eighth trait? Could it have been on a different chromosome? There aren't eight chromosomes. 

It would have to be that eighth trait on the same chromosome, if this theory is right, as one of the existing traits. Then how could it be assorting independently? Because it's going to be on the same chromosome. That's going to be correlated. 

So either Mendel's Law of Inheritance, his Second Law of Inheritance of independent assortment is wrong, or this chromosome theory is wrong. You can't have them both. So who is it? Mendel wrong, or the Chromosome Theory wrong? 

Unfortunately, we don't have enough time for it in today's lecture. So next time, we're going to find out who's right. Before we go on to, take a moment. We've got a question for you about the number of chromosomes that are found in gametes.
