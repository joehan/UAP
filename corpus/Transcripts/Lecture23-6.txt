We've got this pathway here.
We got all these different ways to cause cancer.

How can we treat it?
What's the most common enzyme activity
involved in this pathway?
It's kinase.
Pretty much anything I've said has been a kinase.
It's kinases upon kinases upon kinases.
If you could make a drug to inhibit enzymatic activity,
what enzymatic activity would you like to inhibit?
Kinases.
You'd like a kinase inhibitor.

There happen to be hundreds of kinases in the cell.
Hundreds of kinases.
And of course they all bind ATP in a certain way.
And it was pretty clear to people
that creating a kinase inhibitor was probably impossible.
Because all these enzymes had sort of similar binding
pockets, and kinases were undruggable.
I heard talks about how kinases we're undruggable.
And good reasons why kinases where undruggable.
Because they had similar binding pockets and all that.
Turned out to be totally false.
It turned out despite the good arguments
why it might be impossible to make kinase inhibitors,
folks made kinase inhibitors.
In fact, the first kinase inhibitors
were made against this BCR-ABL fusion protein.
That's why I've mentioned it.
Because this BCR-ABL fusion is present in a certain kind
of cancer of the white blood cells.
chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML.

And the gene, that fusion gene, the fusion
between the BCR and the ABL, was cloned and identified
by molecular biology.
The protein was identified and it
was possible to transfer that protein into,
using a viral vector, into mice.
And it would cause a leukemia-like disease
in the mice.
That told us that that fusion protein was actually
enough to cause that cancer on its own.
It was pretty impressive.
And then people could use the tools of molecular biology
that we've talked about, and mutate the gene.
And ask what part of the gene was
necessary to cause the cancer?
And they found that the kinase activity was necessary.
Without the kinase activity they couldn't do it.
That led them to try to make an inhibitor for the kinase.
So they made an inhibitor for the kinase.
And they showed that it could prevent the fusion gene
from transforming cells into cancer cells in the mouse
or in a dish, in a Petri plate.
That led them to go into human patients.
So using all our tools of molecular biology,
this BCR-ABL fusion was cloned, identified
sequence, transferred with a virus
into mice, transferred into cells.
Cause the leukemia.
Mutated.
Figure out what parts are necessary.
They develop a drug to inhibit it.
They show it in cells.
They show it in animal models.
And they take that kinase inhibitor,
and then they go into human patients, in a clinical trial.

And what they found was that of the first 31 patients
that they tested it in, the number that responded was 31.

It was extraordinary.

Essentially all CML, 95% or more of CML, this leukemia,
has this translocation.
Is an essential thing and essentially all the patients
responded quite dramatically.
Wow.
Now here's the translocation.
In fact it produces a scrawny little chromosome number
22, because it translocates a little bit of chromosome 9
onto chromosome 22 there.
And it was discovered by folks in Philadelphia.
So it's always been referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome,
go figure.
And it creates this fusion gene here, BCR to ABL,
and it so happens that this molecule is called Gleevec.
Gleevec is this inhibitor, and it
sits in the active site of the kinase here.
Now, this is almost, but not completely, a cure.
It's almost but not completely a cure
because, occasionally, mutations can rise that make the ABL
kinase resistant to Gleevec.

Here's one of them.
if this threonine at position 315
mutates to an isoleucine, little bump here,
the drug doesn't fit anymore.
At a rate of about 5% or 10% a year,
patients will develop a mutation that makes
them resistant to Gleevec.
But it's only 5% or 10% of patients per year develop it.
So 5% to 10% probability per year,
we get resistance to Gleevec.
And it's almost always associated
with mutations in the active site of the ABL kinase.

The only exceptions that I know of
are amplification of the ABL kinase.
To have so much ABL kinase that the drug can't block it.

So what people have then been doing is,
they're making other drugs that will bind even though there's
this mutation.
Other inhibitors.
And so you get other inhibitors that can come in here and bind.
These mutations here, can make the kinase
resistant to Gleevec, but it'll still
be sensitive to these guys.
Actually only this mutation and a little bit of these mutations
will make it resistant to both of these guys.
So people are developing second generation Gleevec.
And then a third generation Gleevec,
because this activity is absolutely essential for CML.
And if you can block that activity, you defeat CML.
And people were really excited because it
was pretty clear that's all you have to do.
Develop the right kinase inhibitor, do the right thing,
and you're in business.
Around the year 2000, 2001, there was enormous excitement.
That was it.
Just get the right kinase inhibitor.
And maybe you'll have to get a next generation
and next generation, but you've got a whole solution.
It isn't quite that simple in most other cancers.
In most other cancers, it's a little trickier.
So for example, for example in lung cancer,
there is an EGFR inhibitor.

One of those growth factor receptors.
An EGFR inhibitor, when it was tested on lung cancer patients,
showed a very curious thing.

It worked very well on about 10% or 15% of the patients,
but not all the rest.
And it turned out, those were the 10% or 15%
of the patients that had activating mutations in EGFR.
So lung cancer wasn't as homogeneous as CML.
10% or 15% of the patients, this mechanism.
All right, we say, OK, fine.
That'll work for those 10% or 15% of the patients,
and you see pretty impressive responses.
The problem is that they relapsed also.
So this works.

It works in 10% to 15% of patients, but they relapse.
Typically, most patients relapse in 6 to 18 months.

And some of the relapses don't have
to do with mutations in the active site.
They have to do with mutations elsewhere.
And recently there's an amazing drug in melanoma.

Remember I said melanoma, 50% of melanomas
have mutations in that RAF protein?
Well people made an inhibitor for the kinase
of the RAF protein, a kinase inhibitor for the RAF protein.
And, amazingly, it works.
BRAF inhibitors.

And here it's nothing short of miraculous to see what happens.
I've just shown you over here in this picture a patch of skin.
And I actually have a picture of the entire patient's trunk,
but it's a little gross so I'm not going to show it to you.
I've got a little patch and you can
see all of these different melanoma lesions,
all these little distributed tumors,
all over the patient's trunk.

In response to the drug, they all go away.
But the problem is 6 to 9 months later,
they all come back because other mutations happen in the cancer.
Because some of those cancer cells, a tiny minority
of those cancer cells, have mutations
that make them resistant to the drug.
And they start growing back.

So is that a success or a failure?
(mixed student answers)
Well first point is, you might have bought somebody a year.
That's not to be sneezed at.
Another thing though is that you've
managed to kill the vast majority of the cancer cells.
And only a small, tiny minority have some other mutation
that has caused them to be resistant.
Could you find the mutation?
Well actually some people here in Boston,
working at the Broad Institute, and some other folks as well,
found the mutations.
And it turns out they activate something else.
And it so happens that there are drugs against that something
else.
It's another kinase.
Maybe you could make a combination.
A cocktail of two.
And you know what happens if you do that?
We don't know yet, because it's in clinical trials.
This is kind of on the edge.
Or in cell culture it works, but that's not
the same thing as in a patient.
And now maybe the chance that you'll
see mutations that work against both will be lower.
And if it comes back, there might be a three-drug cocktail.
Because it turns out not that many cancers
are as simple as CML.
But that's no reason to be discouraged.
It's a reason to say it might take two or three or four
places to have to block the cancer
in the possible mutations.
But the more we know about the circuitry,
the more we can figure out where's
the new mutation crop up.
And remember there's only a finite number of cancer cells.
10 to the 12th we said, there are only
going to be 10 to the 12th cells in that tumor.
If the probability that a cell had a mutation was one in 10
to the fifth.
Well, OK, the chance that it might have the two mutations
might be one in 10 to the 10th, but the chance it
might have three mutations, one in 10 to the 15th.
And there's only 10 to the 12 cells.
We win.
That's the game we're playing.
There's a numbers game in combinatorial therapy.
And you're now roughly up to the edge
of what we know about cancer.
Now what we'd really like to know is in all these cancers--
now there are other strategies I haven't told you about.
Because I've only picked on these kinases here.
There are other things.
There are cases, remember I said the HER2 receptor was
amplified?
It was over expressed.
There's actually antibodies against the HER2 receptor.
That can be given to women with breast cancers that
have amplified HER2.
And that causes an immune attack, or internalization,
it's not entirely clear, of cells with the over-expression
of this receptor.
And that can help.
That's called a drug called Herceptin.
And there's a variety of other strategies.
People are coming up with strategies.
And the more you know about the circuitry,
the more you can come up with strategies.
I don't want to pretend this is easy.
This is the sort of thing that will be the work of decades.
So whatever the New York Times tells you,
how come we haven't cured cancer yet despite the fact
that we have all this human genome and molecular biology?
You've got to realize, this is seriously
the work of several decades.
But you've got a whole bunch of people
trying to work out the circuitry,
figure out where it's broken, and work out
places to intervene.

What's been cool is in the past four or five years,
as we talked about with DNA sequencing,
it's gotten so cheap that you could sequence every patient's
own cancer.
And compare it to the normal DNA,
and find that patient's mutations.
And you can imagine a world where
every patient will have their genome sequence,
and their tumor sequence.
And a physician could use that information,
as we collect more of it, to figure out
which drugs to be using in which combinations.
And that's sort of a world we're all imagining right now.
Is a world where that could happen.

It's going to take a lot of work to get there.
And in my opinion it's going to take a lot of sharing.
Because we're going to need information
pooled from patients around the world.
Because we're going to have to learn which patients respond
well to which drugs as a function of which mutations
they have.
And then if they have a relapse and the cancer
becomes resistant to the drug, which mutations have happened.
We're going to need to pool all that.
Which means, I think, we're going
to need to have some kind of common agreed
upon data-sharing mechanisms where patients can voluntarily,
it's up to them, but voluntarily say, count me in.
I'm willing to share my data with other people sharing
their data, so we can build a big enough data set that we
can learn what works best.
And I wouldn't be surprised if over the next couple years
we see a kind of alliance across many institutions in the world
and patients in many countries, to try
to create that knowledge base.
It's kind of like a human cancer Genome Project,
but where it's the humans who are involved, who are doing it.
Or the patients who are doing it.
And I think it's going to be a really important thing.
Because I've told you a story right
now about a very simplified version of cancer.
Cancer is very complicated.
I've left out lots of steps, lots of controls, and all that.
But I've probably told you just enough
to imagine what's going on in that overall complex picture.
And that we could, if we pile up more and more information,
get to the point where we can play this game strategically.
And if we develop enough drugs, we'll have on the shelf
enough drugs to use enough combinations.
And I hope that by the time, God forbid, some of you
will require this.
And statistically a non-trivial fraction of you
will get cancer in your lifetime.
I'm hoping that we'll have made enough progress by that point
to offer better and better odds.
Anyway that's the concise version
of how cells send growth signals,
how cancers can happen, and how we
can begin to make drugs that, in a targeted and less toxic way,
fight back against cancer.
So that's it for cancer.
OK, before we go on, stop a moment
and answer this question about anti-cancer therapies.
