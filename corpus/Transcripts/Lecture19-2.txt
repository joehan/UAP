If I look at two species.
let's say the human and the mouse genome, what do I see?
Well, I guess the first thing is, I need a mouse genome.
We had the human genome.
We realized we would need, if we're
going to do these kind of evolutionary comparisons,
more species.
By comparing humans and mice, we might
be able to see what was in common, what was different.
We actually thought about that at the time,
this was around 2001, as kind of a Rosetta Stone.
Where we have the same text in different languages.
So it's written in human, and it's written in mouse.
Of course, not exactly the same text.
Humans and mice aren't exactly the same,
but they're pretty similar in body plans.
Things like that.
So anyway, we thought about this a lot as a Rosetta Stone.
And so we really wanted the mouse genome.
And by 2002, we had a rough draft sequence of the mouse
genome, and a few years later we had a finished sequence
of the mouse genome.
And we could start comparing the human and the mouse.
And what we saw, if we looked at those two species.
And we picked a gene in the human.
I'm going to represent the exons here.
Exon.
Exon.
Exon.
Exon.
And I'm going to go like that to indicate that these exons are,
when they are transcribed into RNA, spliced up
into a single gene.
So this is one gene.
I don't know what we'll call it.
We'll just call it gene number-- well,
I'm going to call it beta globin.
Beta globin actually has three, I believe,
but anyway, three exons, not four.
But we'll just call it beta globin
for the sake of argument.
In the mouse is there are similar gene?
There is.
In fact, for a typical gene, it looks like that.
It has the exact same exon structure.
The exons start and stop at the same places usually.

Very interesting.
Why is that?

There's a common ancestor.
There's a common ancestor of mouse and human.
And it had that gene with that exon structure.
And it was passed down to the two descendants.
And we can see that in the exon structure.
Is that distance?
Sorry?
Is it distance?
Is the distance?
Did I draw the distance the same?
I didn't quite draw it the same.
You could line this up pretty well,
but actually, the way I drew it on the board,
it looks like the mouse gene's a little smaller.
On average, that's right.
The human genome is about 3 billion bases,
and the mouse is about two and a half billion bases.
Most of it, though, has to do with that non-genic DNA.
In fact, what's going on, what changes there are here
are transposable elements have hopped in in different numbers.
New different transposable elements.
Deletions have occurred.
And on average a little more stuff is in the human,
because of transposons hopping in
or deletions occurring in the mouse.
But it lines up pretty well.
Now there are, of course, single base changes.
On average, in a totally neutral piece of DNA,
that's present in both species.
Let's see, I said about 0.2 changes occur over
a million years.
So if I compare to our common ancestor between human
and mouse, there were 0.2 changes back
to our common ancestor, and 0.2 changes along the mouse
lineage to mouse.
So the difference between-- if 0.2 changes occurred
from common ancestor to human, and common ancestor to mouse,
the difference between human and mouse
will be about 0.4 changes.
That a 40% chance that a base has changed
between human and mouse.
And that's about what we observe.
And it turns out, if I give you a long DNA
sequence in which about 40% of the letters have changed,
you can still write a piece of computer code
that will line them up.
Remember, it's a four-letter code.
So that means there's maybe a 60% chance
that the letters match, but at random there'd
be a 25% chance the letters match.
You can still detect that.
So you actually line up the sequences of human and mouse,
and count the changes.

Do you think the changes are as frequent in the protein coding
sequences?
Why not?
Can't changes occur there, too?
Won't mutations happen in the protein coding sequences?
They die out.
They die out there.
And there's selection.
So in fact we observe fewer changes
not because fewer changes are occurring,
but because those are selected against.
And we can measure the evolutionary constraint,
or evolutionary conservation, and there's greater
conservation-- greater sequence conservation-- in the exons
than in the introns, for example.
Telling us that these are functionally pretty important.
And there you go.
You can line that up.
Pretty cool.
You can go a little further.
You can look at many species.

Let's see.
We'll look at, let's say, humans.

And we'll look at chimps and the macaque monkey.

And the lemur.
And, say, the dog.
In the evolutionary tree that relates these guys,
humans and chimps are closest, and then macaques,
and then lemurs, and then dogs.
So suppose I told you that at one specific base
I'm going to pick a single base in the middle of an intron
of beta-globin chains.
Some single base.
Here is the base.
I've lined up the species and I'm
going to look at them in human, and chimp, and other things.
Suppose human has at that one base a G,
and the macaque has a G, and the lemur has an A,
and the dog has an A at that one base of that one gene.
I could do this 3 billion more times,
but I'm just picking one of them right now.
Here's my gene.
I'm looking at this one base, and that's what I see.
What can you tell me about what happened
over evolutionary history at that base?
Did that base change?
When did it change?
Position the mutation for me.

Right there.
That's where the mutation occurred.
What happened was an A went to a G
somewhere during that lineage.
You can tell that.

What do you think the chimp has?
Prediction.

Does it have to be G?
Why not?
How could it not be a G?
Student answer.
It could have had-- it should have been a G coming down
to here, but it might have had a mutation in the chimp.
But if it's only 5 million years,
the chances are not so good.
In fact, let's see, we would expect about 1 change in 100.
There's about a 1% chance that it wouldn't be a G,
give or take.
So that means you now know your betting odds.
You're going to bet 99 to 1 it's a G. And if I were
to look at 100 such positions in the genome that look like that,
99 of them should look like this, and one of them
might be different.
It checks out.
Modulo my rough arithmetic here, but it checks out.
This is like stunning, because if these species were not
related by an evolutionary tree, you would not predict that.
You would not predict it, because the human
and the macaque agree, but differ here.
The chimp will agree, but 99, but not 100% of the time.
But that's what you get.
It checks out beautifully.
These to me are the most stunning demonstrations
of evolution and evolutionary reconstruction
that one can imagine.
You can date it reasonably well.
We can actually go a step further.
We can look not at one gene, but many genes,
to look at gene order.

Oh, actually, before I do gene order.
I got ahead of myself for a second.
Forgive me.
There's one other thing we can do.

Suppose in the human genome, at this position
a specific transposon had hopped in at that base.

And suppose we also saw that transposon hop in here,
but wasn't present there.
When did that transposon hop in?

There.
What is the chance it's not present in the chimp?

Transposons don't hop out.

It's got to be there.
It's got to be there.
And, in fact, at exactly that very base, you find it.
Unless, of course, a bigger deletion took out
that whole chunk of DNA.
But if the chunk of DNA is present,
the transposons is present.
Pretty impressive stuff, that it's exactly to the base
you see this stuff there.
Anyway that's fun, but now many genes.

Suppose I saw a bunch of genes in the human.

Gene one, gene two, gene three, gene four, gene five, gene six.
In the mouse, well, I already said gene one's structure
looked the same, typically.
If these were the exons, we would
see a similar exonic structure in the mouse.

But would we see the same genes in the same order?

Well, it's an empirical question.
If you begin lining up sequences,
typically, they line up.

Over the course of, not the whole chromosome, but often,
for stretches of about a million or several million bases,
you see exactly the same genes in the same order.
See you can take a million bases of human chromosome
14 and a million bases of mouse chromosome 12,
and line up sequences across it.
And see that not just was this little gene the same
between those species, but the million bases was
the same between the species.
A whole million bases.
What does that tell you?
It tells you that million bases has even
stayed together since the origin of mammals,
100 million years ago.
Now why doesn't it keep going all the way more than several--
yes, please.
How was it chosen to have the human chromosome 14 and mouse
chromosome 12?
Just randomly?
How were they named?
No, how were they-- was it like--
Lined up that way?
Yeah.
We ran a computer program, and said,
take this part of human chromosome
14, and is there any part of the mouse that matches up?
And then, but you could do that to the next piece
of chromosome 14.
And what do you see if you go to the next piece of chromosome
14, over here?
It might match a different part of the mouse genome.
How could that happen?

Suppose sometimes chromosomes break,
and you get chromosomal translocations, rearrangements.
Not very often, but with some frequency
breaks occur, and you get a translocated chromosome.
And if that were to be evolutionarily
selected or fixed, then the mouse
could acquire a new scrambled order.
Well, in fact, by doing exactly what you just said.
Use the computer to run across here
and say what matches in the mouse,
you can build a look-up table.
Here's a look-up table.
These are the mouse chromosomes, and how
they match up with the different human chromosomes.
And so we have a whole look-up table covering about 95%
of the genome.
This says any particular part of mouse
matches this part of the human.
Any particular part of human matches this part of the mouse.
You can see that they were the same genome 100 million years,
ago but scrambled.
On average is about 200 scramblings,
200 breaks and reunions.
Cuts and pastes that occurred across the genome.
And you can reconstruct those.
And you can reconstruct them across many other species.
And you can watch the whole thing have happened
in evolutionary time, of genomes rearranging
at a slow but steady rate.
All of those events occur.
And when you see the events occur in this part of the tree,
all the organisms in that part of the tree
tend to have that event.
All right.
Any questions about this?
Yes.
How do you end up with the different number of chromosomes
for different species?
How do you end up with a different number of chromosomes
for different species?
Turns out that chromosomes can break and rearrange
in such a way that they both have a centromere.
And you get an extra chromosome.
It's very rare, but it does happen.
So mice have 20 chromosomes.
We have 23 chromosomes.
And so you might fuse a chunk of one chromosome
onto the other chromosome, and lose that centromere.
So they now hang out together.
You might break in such way.
Maybe add a centromere.
So weird things happen.
They happen with great rarity.
Right?
We're talking about handfuls of events over the course of 100
million years.
But they happen.
And we see the results of that.
And with enough species now having been reconstructed,
having been sequenced, we can actually
reconstruct those events.
OK, to make sure you understand that material,
test yourself with this question about evolutionary comparison.
