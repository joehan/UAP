Hi. It's Samin again. So how did you do? Let's discuss how to arrive at the answers. In the first example, we have PDGFR, which is a growth factor receptor. That means when the growth factor binds to it, it promotes cell division. Therefore, this protein will be classified as a proto-oncogene. 

Now let's look at the alleles. The first one is wild type, and the second one has a mutation that truncates the resulting protein. Remember that this is not a gain- of- function mutation, and we still have the other copy of the gene. Therefore, the cell will divide appropriately in the presence of the ligand. 

In the second example, we have APC, which halts the cell cycle. Therefore, it's a tumor suppressor gene. The first allele has a mutation in the promoter, preventing its transcription. And we will not have any protein expression. The second allele results in a non-functional truncated protein. Therefore, the cell has lost both copies of APC, and it will become transformed. 

In the third example, we have p16, which inhibits the cell cycle. And therefore, it is going to be classified as a tumor suppressor gene. The first allele is wild type and functioning normally. But the second one has a 10 base pair deletion causing a frame shift early in the sequence. And therefore, resulting in a non-functional protein. 

However, since you still have a functioning copy, the phenotype of the cell would be normal. In the fourth example, we have RAS, which you already have learned is a proto-oncogene, because it promotes cell division. Allele one has a big deletion, and therefore won't make any functional protein. However, allele two has a mutation that causes RAS to be always GTP bound, and hence, in the active state, as it cannot get rid of GTP. 

Therefore, this is a gain-of- function mutation, and will continuously stimulate the cell to divide. In the fifth example, we are looking at EGF receptor, a protein that when bound to its ligand, promotes cell division. Therefore, a proto-oncogene. The first copy of the gene is wild type, but the second copy codes for a receptor that can dimerize without the growth factor, and will therefore inappropriately simulate the cells to divide. 

This will lead to uncontrolled cell division, and therefore, a transformed phenotype. I hope you enjoyed this exercise, and now have a better understanding of how cancer cells originate.
