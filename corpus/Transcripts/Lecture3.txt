PROFESSOR: Welcome back to 7.00x, Introduction to Biology, the Secret of Life. This week we've got three lectures for you. The first is about amazing proteins. You'll see all sorts of proteins and we'll talk about the structures of proteins. In the second lecture, we're going to talk about enzymes, those remarkable proteins that carry out chemical transformations in the cell. And then in the third lecture, we're going to talk about biochemical pathways, how enzymes are strung together to carry out whole series of transformations. In particular, we're going to talk about one pathway called glycolysis that breaks down sugar. 

In addition to the lectures, you'll see on the course website we've got some lab videos for you this week. Nathaniel is going to go to the lab and show you how to purify some proteins. He's going to purify green fluorescent protein and also an enzyme called beta-galactosidase. Brian is going to show you how we really know about the structures of proteins through x-ray crystallography. And then finally, the problems this week are particularly cool. We have electronic problems this week where you can actually see and spin around in zoom in on proteins to really understand their structure. And we have a game for you, the web-based game called "Foldit," where you yourself can fold proteins. 

Glad to have you back for week two of 7.00x. Looking forward to it.
