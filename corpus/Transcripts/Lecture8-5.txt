PROFESSOR: But let's really talk about real human genetics, section four. After we've done the toy problems, real human genetics. Can we go back to this pedigree here that you so docilely allow me to put up there? 

Have one affected person, no affected parents-- one in four. And you have already a knee-jerk reaction that that's autosomal recessive. Do you know what the phenotype happens to be in that pedigree? 

What trait am I talking about? I didn't actually tell you, did I? That's getting hit by a truck. 

It turns out that she got hit by a truck. None of her siblings got hit by a truck. And as it happens, neither of her parents got hit by a truck. Is that autosomal recessive? No. 

Looking at one little pedigree like this, you can't say anything is even genetic. That's a big issue. How do you know that the thing was genetic? 

I wrote four kids. You color in one kid. You say, autosomal recessive, right? 

But if you're a human geneticist and you see-- look, this is real human genetics. Someone comes into the clinic, and they have an unusual phenotype. Someone comes in and they have an unusual disease. 

One person has it. Their siblings don't have it. The parents don't have it. How does a geneticist know that's genetic? 

Or suppose I start seeing a pedigree here. That person's affected. And then over here, that person's affected. 

What's that? Maybe it's x-linked. Yeah, but maybe not. Maybe it's got infected with tuberculosis. 

How do you know that that's not something that had an environmental thing, that somehow was similar in families. How do you know that's not dominant, by the way? How do you know that's not dominant? 

STUDENT: Then everyone-- 

PROFESSOR: Because it's not in the father here, right? Well, what if it's dominant with incomplete penetrance? Now wait, I said x-link. Could it be x-linked? 

No, it can't, because look, it transmitted through a male. So we're pretty sure it's not x-linked. But it could be dominant with incomplete penetrance. It is dominant. It could be an environmental thing. 

Guys, how do you know? Outside of the context of a toy problem on an exam, how do you know when you start looking at pedigrees? How do we know that it's not something that has to do with your diet? 

How do we know it's not something-- how do we know any of that? How do we know if something is even genetic? Now you think this is trivial. 

Tell me what you'd do for this recessive disease. Will one pedigree do? You're never going to be able to learn it from one pedigree. What do you have to do? For an autosomal recessive, what do you have to do? Lots of pedigrees. 

If I got lots and lots of pedigrees-- now obviously, the right pedigree I want is the Mendel kind of pedigree, 5,270 whatever, 2,000 whatever. I'm not getting that in humans, right? Most human families decide to have fewer than several thousand children. 

Most human pedigrees will have one affected person. Human families are small. So I'm going to go out. I'm going to collect-- let's take cystic fibrosis, OK? Cystic fibrosis. 

I collect families with cystic fibrosis. And in those families, a typical number of kids with cystic fibrosis, in a family with cystic fibrosis, is one. How am I going to know that that's genetic and recessive? 

STUDENT: Look at the actual genes. 

PROFESSOR: Well, but I can't look at the actual genes yet. I haven't even got DNA yet in evidence. And I might not have it. And I wouldn't have even designed my study to find the genes, that I was convinced it was genetic. 

Geneticists have to know something is genetic. Look at their ancestors. And for an autosomal recessive, they're not affected. Same as getting hit by a truck, right? 

So the ancestors aren't affected. Look at their children for the autosomal recessive. Well, they probably didn't marry anybody who was a carrier. The children are probably not affected either. 

What's the only thing I have to hang my hat on? What's the only thing I have to use that might tell me it's autosomal recessive? 

STUDENT: Across a large population. 

PROFESSOR: Across a large population, I look for what? 

STUDENT: The similar disease. 

PROFESSOR: Well, now a lot of people have cystic fibrosis. There's typically one person affected. I can't look at transmission, because usually, for an autosomal recessive that's kind of rare in the population, I don't see transmission for an autosomal recessive. 

STUDENT: Compare their lifestyles. 

PROFESSOR: Sorry? 

STUDENT: Compare their lifestyles. 

PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm going to sit there and get your whole lifestyle. What do you want to tell me about? I'm going to get 1,000 people to tell me all about their lifestyle. It's true, if I found something I could rule it out, maybe on the basis of that. 

What else have I got to work on? What would Mendel do? Yes? 

STUDENT: Look at affected and affected children and affected and non-affected children. 

PROFESSOR: So I've got affected-affected marriages. I got to go out and arrange marriages between people with cystic fibrosis. 

STUDENT: I'm sure there are some out there. 

PROFESSOR: OK, so I look at some. And that'll help. I could. If I look at some, I can see if an affected and an affected get married, maybe all their children will be affected. That would sure help me a lot. What else? 

STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] get mice. 

PROFESSOR: Get mice. I'm going to sit around looking for mice with cystic fibrosis. No, I've got to do human genetics. What do you want? 

STUDENT: I was going to suggest the same thing. 

PROFESSOR: Mice. I could do it. It would be great. But how do I even know it's the same human disease, guys? What's the only thing I have going for me? 

STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]. 

PROFESSOR: Three to one, that's all I got going for me, right? That's what Mendel taught us, three to one. What proportion of the kids in these families will have cystic fibrosis, if I average out across a whole lot of families? 1/4, right? 

If I got a large number of families, and I saw that across a large number of families with cystic fibrosis the proportion of affecteds and unaffecteds was 1/4 affected and 3/4 unaffected, how would you feel? 

STUDENT: Pretty good. 

PROFESSOR: Pretty good. But it doesn't work like that, it turns out. Because if you actually measure it, it's not 1/4. It's about 1/3. 

Real human genetics, guys. It's about 1/3. It's not 1/4. Why is it not Mendel's ratio? 

STUDENT: The world isn't perfect? 

PROFESSOR: Sorry? 

STUDENT: The world isn't perfect. 

PROFESSOR: The world isn't perfect? No, the world's perfect in genetics. Genetics is perfect. 

But it's 1/3, not 1/4. Now don't write this down as if it's a law. This is a problem. And we're going to figure out why it's 1/3, even though we know it's supposed to be 1/4. Yes? 

STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]. 

PROFESSOR: Bingo. Bingo. We collected families with cystic fibrosis. Parents were carriers. They happened to have a kid with cystic fibrosis. We collected the family. 

Were there any families where parents got married who were carriers and, by chance, they had no kids with cystic fibrosis? Sure, small families. Did we count those families? [SHAKES HEAD] Because we didn't collect those families. 

Because we're leaving out all of those cases, we are over-representing cases in which have cystic fibrosis, by leaving out cases that don't have cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis really truly, when you do the arithmetic, or do a real study, turns out to be about 1/3, on average. That has to do with the size of human families and things like that. 

If all human families were hundreds of kids, that would never happen. You would never have a family that were both carriers and wouldn't have a kid with cystic fibrosis. Statistically, it would be too rare. But for small families it happens. 

So oh my goodness, we can't even trust one in four. Right? So it turns out that to do this stuff right, you collect large families, and you actually run computer programs that take models, including the models that you missed people, that you missed certain families. 

In your computer program you say, let's assume it's autosomal recessive. Let's assume it has this frequency. Let's assume a certain exclusion of family sizes. What's the chance I missed that? 

And now what's the-- how well does that fit in autosomal recessive model? Let's assume it's a dominant trait with a certain amount of incomplete penetrance. How well does it fit these hundreds of families? 

That's what real human geneticists did, for quite a long time, was try to fit this stuff. Because that's the only way you could do it, because you can't actually set up crosses. Well, you can if you-- you can set up your own cross, if you find somebody nice, and he or she agrees. But other than that, you can't set up other crosses. 

And because of it, real you human genetics is hard. It's really hard, because you don't numbers. And the ratios are all screwed up, because you don't have the right numbers and because you have alternative explanations. Big numbers are needed. Computer programs are needed. 

Let me tell you how much trouble you can get in when you don't actually think rigorously. I told you, back in the early part of the 20th century, around 1900 or so, people got interested in human genetics. They went out and they found families, for example, with Huntington's disease, with other traits, polydactyly. Well, they also found other families. 

For example, here's a family, big pedigree. What do you think this is? Well, males here are affected. Male here. 

This is transmitting clearly through generations, right? Skips over this female there. Let's see. Trans-- oh, look a transmission-- actually, that's kind of funny. That person's affected. The husband of his daughter is affected and transmits it to the son. 

It's a little weird. Didn't stop them. This was declared to be a genetic tendency. And this is called thalassophilia. 

Does anyone know what the Greek word thalasso means? It means the sea. Philia means love. Love of the sea, sea-faringness, being a sea captain. 

So it was generally thought, at least by one, Charles Davenport, that being a sea captain was probably genetic, because you could find long lines of father-to-son transmission of sea captainess. I'm serious. You think I joke. 

Charles Davenport was an incredibly enthusiastic biologist, in the early part of the 20th century, who started what is today called the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, one of the most famous places in molecular biology. At the time, what he started was called the eugenics records office. 

And eugenics did not have a bad name back then. Eu means good. Eugenics, good genes. 

And the preface I was reading to you, from Charles Davenport here, it says, recent great advances in our knowledge of heredity have revolutionized the method of agriculturists in improving domesticated plants and animals. It was early recognized that this new knowledge would have far-reaching influence upon certain problems of human society, the problems of the unsocial classes, of immigration, of population, of effectiveness, of health and vigor. 

And he goes on with a huge book. They were collecting records upon records upon records and documenting all sorts of stuff that seemed to transmit in families, without a lot of attention to whether it was really genetic fitting a Mendelian model or sort of kind of transmitted in families. 

So I'll tell you, when we were-- I was going through the literature to look at Morgan papers about sex linkage and other things, I ran into a Morgan paper. And it was about five sex-linked genes, this Morgan paper. It was called, "The Origin of Five Mutations in Eye Color in Drosophila and Their Modes of Inheritance." And as it happens, when you print out pages, you also get the next article that starts at the bottom of the page. 

Right after the Inheritance of Five Genes in Drosophila for different eye color mutations, the next article is "Heredity in Insanity." And it contains this table from this-- by the way, this is the journal Science, one of the leading journals in the world today-- at the time too, in 1911-- has this wonderful table. 

The fact that nervous and mental diseases are often transmitted by heredity was known to Hippocrates and since his time has been amply illustrated by insane hospital statistics. But the exact conditions under which such transmission occurs have never been fully understood. A recent study, however, has revealed some data which seem to indicate that certain forms of insanity are transmitted from parent to offspring, in the manner of a trait, which is, in the Mendelian sense, recessive. 

They were all so excited about this stuff in 1911. And they show you all these things, just like we were doing. Both parents, being neuropathic-- here meaning insane-- all children will be neuropathic. 

One parent being normal, but with a neuropathic taint from the grandparent, and the other parent being neuropathic, half the children will be neuropathic and half will be normal, but capable of transmitting the neuropathic make-up to their progeny. One parent being normal, of normal ancestry, and the other parent being neuropathic, all the children will be normal but capable of transmitting the neuropathic. You get the point. 

They just, with tremendous vigor, were looking at everything in the human population and calling it recessive and dominant and this and that. It was remarkable. There was a trait, for example, has all sorts of skin rashes and irritations and things like that, very common in the South, called Pellagra. And Pellagra clearly transmitted in poverty. I'm sorry, it transmitted in families in the South. Sorry, Pellagra clearly transmitted in families. 

And a commission, a government commission said, because of the transmission of Pellagra in families, it was genetic. But I already jumped to it, it's a disease of malnutrition. It's a disease due to a niacin deficiency. 

Malnutrition clusters in families. It transmits in families, because poverty transmits in families-- at least transmitted in families then. And they had a lot of trouble telling the difference between a disease that was a result of poverty, of malnutrition, and a disease that was a result of heredity. That's why real human genetics matters. Because it's easy to get this stuff wrong. 

We won't be able to, on exams, give you thousands of pedigrees, and ask you to run a computer program to do what's called a segregation analysis. We'll ask you to use the simple rules, the simple toy rules that we teach you. But you should know what makes human genetics exciting-- is we're trying to find out things from a species, our own, that we can't do crosses in. 

We're trying to interpret things from a population. That's what's amazing about human genetics. So real human genetics isn't always as simple as Mendel's crosses. To test your understanding, try this question.
